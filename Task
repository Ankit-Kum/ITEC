Step 2 Create a new Python script pandas_assignment.ipynb. Import Pandas and follow these steps:  


1. Create a DataFrame with the following data:  
  


  data = {
      'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve'],
      'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32, 29],
      'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'HR'],
      'Salary': [45000, 54000, 50000, 62000, 47000]
  }
  a. Print the first five rows of the DataFrame.  
  b. Get the summary statistics of the 'Age' and 'Salary' columns.  
  c. Calculate the average salary of employees in the 'HR' department.  


2. Add a new column, 'Bonus', which is 10% of the salary.  


3. Filter the DataFrame to show employees aged between 25 and 30.  


4. Group the data by 'Department' and calculate the average salary for each department.  


5. Sort the DataFrame by 'Salary' in ascending order and save the result to a new CSV file.

Objective - Develop a deeper understanding of matrices and vectors, including advanced operations, practical 
linear algebra concepts, and their application in data science.


Instructions - Install the numpy library (if not already installed) by running: pip install numpy


1. Matrix and Vector Operations


1. Create a 3 × 3 matrix A and a 3 × 1 vector B :


   import numpy as np
   A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
   B = np.array([1, 2, 3])


   Tasks -
   - Perform matrix-vector multiplication  A X B.
   - Calculate the trace of matrix  A  (sum of diagonal elements).
   - Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.


2. Replace the last row of matrix A with [10, 11, 12] and:
   - Compute the determinant of the updated matrix A.
   - Identify if the updated matrix is singular or non-singular.
